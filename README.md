#### Explain how to work with files: 

Run script ./run_me.sh 

Tasks:

  transfer data.txt to json file 

  it will run mongo db docker and 

  import json in the mongo db

  export records as csv file in host folder

  sort it, remove password

  generate index.html from csv file

  start Nginx web server with index.html

  when finished open chrome or other browser with this url: http://localhost:8882
  
  if your host is not local write the ip instead of localhost

  you can look at screenshots.doc file
